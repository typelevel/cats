# Chain

`Chain` is a data structure that allows constant time prepending and appending.
This makes it especially efficient when used as a `Monoid`, e.g. with `Validated` or `Writer`.
As such it aims to be used where `List` and `Vector` incur a performance penalty.

`List` is a great data type, it is very simple and easy to understand.
It has very low overhead for the most important functions such as `fold` and `map` and also supports prepending a single element in constant time.

Traversing a data structure with something like `Writer[List[Log], A]` or `ValidatedNel[Error, A]` is  powerful and allows us to precisely specify what kind of iteration we want to do while remaining succint.
However, in terms of efficiency it's a whole different story unfortunately.
That is because both of these traversals make use of the `List` monoid (or the `NonEmptyList` semigroup), which by the nature of `List` is very inefficient.
If you use `traverse` with a data structure with `n` elements and `Writer` or `Validated` as the `Applicative` type, you will end up with a runtime of `O(n^2)`.
This is because, with `List`, appending a single element requires iterating over the entire data structure and therefore takes linear time.

So `List` isn't all that great for this use case, so let's use `Vector` or `NonEmptyVector` instead, right?

Well, `Vector` has its own problems and in this case it's unfortunately not that much faster than `List` at all. You can check [this blog post](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html#vectors-are-ok) by Li Haoyi for some deeper insight into `Vector`'s issues.


`Chain` evolved from what used to be `fs2.Catenable` and Erik Osheim's [Chain](https://github.com/non/chain ) library.
Similar to `List`, it is also a very simple data structure, but unlike `List` it supports both constant O(1) time `append` and `prepend`.
This makes its `Monoid` instance super performant and a much better fit for usage with `Validated`,`Writer`, `Ior` or `Const`.

To utilize this Cats includes type aliases like `ValidatedNec` or `IorNec` as well as helper functions like `groupByNec` or `Validated.invalidNec`.

To get a good idea of the performance improvements, here are some benchmarks that test monoidal append (higher score is better):

```
[info] Benchmark                                  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units
[info] CollectionMonoidBench.accumulateChain     thrpt   20  51.911 ± 7.453  ops/s
[info] CollectionMonoidBench.accumulateList      thrpt   20   6.973 ± 0.781  ops/s
[info] CollectionMonoidBench.accumulateVector    thrpt   20   6.304 ± 0.129  ops/s
```

As you can see accumulating things with `Chain` is more than 7 times faster than `List` and over 8 times faster than `Vector`.
So appending is a lot more performant than the standard library collections, but what about operations like `map` or `fold`?
Fortunately we've also benchmarked these (again, higher score is better):

```
[info] Benchmark                           Mode  Cnt          Score         Error  Units
[info] ChainBench.foldLeftLargeChain      thrpt   20        117.267 ±       1.815  ops/s

[info] ChainBench.mapLargeList            thrpt   20         66.729 ±       7.165  ops/s
[info] ChainBench.mapLargeVector          thrpt   20         61.374 ±       2.004  ops/s
```

While not as dominant, `Chain` holds its ground fairly well.
It won't have the random access performance of something like `Vector`, but in a lot of other cases, `Chain` seems to outperform it quite handily.
So if you don't perform a lot of random access on your data structure, then you should be fine using `Chain` extensively instead.

So next time you write any code that uses `List` or `Vector` as a `Monoid`, be sure to use `Chain` instead!
You can also check out the benchmarks [here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/v1.3.0/bench/src/main/scala/cats/bench).

## How it works

`Chain` is a fairly simple data structure compared to something like `Vector`.
It's a simple ADT that has only 4 cases.
It is either an empty `Chain` with no elements, a singleton `Chain` with exactly one element, a concatenation of two chains or a wrapper for another collect
ion.
In code it looks like this:

```tut:book
sealed abstract class Chain[+A]

final case object Empty extends Chain[Nothing]
final case class Singleton[A](a: A) extends Chain[A]
final case class Append[A](left: Chain[A], right: Chain[A]) extends Chain[A]
final case class Wrap[A](seq: Seq[A]) extends Chain[A]
```

The `Append` constructor is what gives us the fast concatenation ability.
Concatenating two existing `Chain`s, is just a call to the `Append` constructor, which is always constant time `O(1)`.

In case we want to append or prepend a single element,
 all we have to do is wrap the element with the `Singleton` constructor and then use the `Append` constructor to append or prepend the `Singleton` `Chain`.

The `Wrap` constructor lifts any `Seq` into a `Chain`.
This can be useful for concatenating already created collections that don't have great concatenation performance.
`Append(Wrap(list1), Wrap(list2)).foldMap(f)` will in general be much faster than just concatenating `list1` and `list2` and folding the result.

`Chain` doesn't directly expose the `Append` and `Wrap` constructors, because the arguments might refer to an empty `Chain` or `Seq`.
Instead of calling `Append` directly you can simply use `Chain.concat` or `++`, which will check if one of the arguments is empty:

```scala
def concat[A](c: Chain[A], c2: Chain[A]): Chain[A] =
  if (c.isEmpty) c2
  else if (c2.isEmpty) c
  else Append(c, c2)
```

To construct a `Chain` from a `Seq` you should use `Chain.fromSeq` which will also check for emptiness:

```scala
def fromSeq[A](s: Seq[A]): Chain[A] =
  if (s.isEmpty) nil
  else if (s.lengthCompare(1) == 0) one(s.head)
  else Wrap(s)
```



In conclusion `Chain` supports constant time appending and prepending, because it builds an unbalance tree of `Append`s.
This unbalanced tree will always allow iteration in linear time. 


## NonEmptyChain 

`NonEmptyChain` is the non empty version of `Chain` it does not have a `Monoid` instance since it cannot be empty, but it does have a `Semigroup` instance.
Likewise, it defines a `NonEmptyTraverse` instace, but no `TraverseFilter` instance.

There are numerous ways to construct a `NonEmptyChain`, e.g. you can create one from a single element, a `NonEmptyList` or a `NonEmptyVector`:

```tut:book
import cats.data._

NonEmptyChain(1, 2, 3, 4)

NonEmptyChain.fromNonEmptyList(NonEmptyList(1, List(2, 3)))
NonEmptyChain.fromNonEmptyVector(NonEmptyVector(1, Vector(2, 3)))

NonEmptyChain.one(1)
```



You can also create an `Option` of `NonEmptyChain` from a `Chain` or any other collection type:

```tut:book
import cats.data._

NonEmptyChain.fromChain(Chain(1, 2, 3))
NonEmptyChain.fromSeq(List.empty[Int])
NonEmptyChain.fromSeq(Vector(1, 2, 3))
```

Sometimes, you'll want to prepend or append a single element to a chain and return the result as a `NonEmptyChain`:

```tut:book
import cats.data._

NonEmptyChain.fromChainAppend(Chain(1, 2, 3), 4)
NonEmptyChain.fromChainAppend(Chain.empty[Int], 1)
NonEmptyChain.fromChainPrepend(1, Chain(2, 3))
```
