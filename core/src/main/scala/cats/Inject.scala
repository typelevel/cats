/**
 * Inject is a type class providing an injection from type `A` into
 * type `B`. An injection is a function `inj` which does not destroy
 * any information: for every `b: B` there is at most one `a: A` such
 * that `inj(a) = b`.
 *
 * Because of this all injections admit partial inverses `prj` which
 * pair a value `b: B` back with a single value `a: A`.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @note Prior to cats 1.0, Inject handled injection for type
 * constructors. For injection of type constructors, use [[InjectK]].
 *
 * @see [[InjectK]] for injection for [[cats.data.EitherK]]
