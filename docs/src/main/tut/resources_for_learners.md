# Books
 * [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
   by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason - While this book does not
   specifically cover Cats, it is a great introduction to functional
   programming in Scala in general and covers some of the abstractions
   that can be found in Cats.
 * [Advanced Scala with Cats](http://underscore.io/books/advanced-scala/) 
   by Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell - The aims of this book are two-fold: 
   to introduce monads, functors, and other functional programming patterns
   as a way to structure program design, and to explain how these 
   concepts are implemented in Cats.

# Tutorials
 * [herding cats](http://eed3si9n.com/herding-cats/) by Eugene Yokota
 * [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/cats) by 47 Degrees 
   offers multiple online exercises to learn about the type classes and 
   datatypes included in Cats.
   
# Videos
 * [Functional Structures in Scala](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrwDVdSrYE6dy14XCmUtRAJuhCxuzJp0) 
   by [Michael Pilquist](https://github.com/MPilquist) offers a series
   of lectures about basic functional structures. 
 * [Category Theory for Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) 
   by [Bartosz Milewski](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski) is a series 
   of category theory lectures oriented towards programmers. The sample code
   is in basic Haskell/C++ but the course is designed for programmers of all 
   background to follow. 
* [Easy and efficient data validation with Cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8nGAo3Jp-Q) by [Daniela Sfregola](https://danielasfregola.com/)  this talk introduces Cats, and some of its most interesting components for data validation. In particular, we’ll discuss some options to achieve efficient and expressive data validation. We will also argue that, compared to other options in the language, Cats is particularly suited for the task thanks to its easy-to-use data types and more approachable syntax.
