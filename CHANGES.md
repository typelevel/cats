Version 0.5.0 is the fifth release.

This release includes some API changes:

`cats.laws.discipline.eq` no longer provides `Eq` instances for `Tuple2` and `Tuple3`, these instances and together with some other new instances for `Tuple`s are now provided by `cats.std.tuple` (through inheriting the instance trait defined in algebra 0.4.2).

## Version 0.4.1

> 2016 February 4

Version 0.4.1 is a patch release in the 0.4 series and is binary compatible with
version 0.4.0.

This patch fixes bugs with the `dropWhile` methods on `Streaming` and
`StreamingT`.

This release corrects outdated build/POM metadata, which should fix API doc URLS.

Bug fixes:

* [#856](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/856): Fix `Streaming` and `StreamingT` `dropWhile` functions

Build/publishing changes:

* [#852](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/852) Update build with org change

Documentation and site improvements:

* [#859](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/859) Add Contravariant documentation page
* [#861](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/861) Docs: Revive useful links section. Update URLs

## Version 0.4.0

> 2016 February 1

Version 0.4.0 is the fourth release of the Cats library, and the first release
published under the `org.typelevel` group from the
[Typelevel](https://github.com/typelevel) organization on GitHub (previous
releases had been published to `org.spire-math` from `non/cats`). This means
that users will need to change the `groupId` for their Cats dependencies when
updating. If you have a line like this in your SBT build configuration, for
example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.spire-math" %% "cats" % "0.3.0"
```

You will need to change it to the following:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats" % "0.4.0"
```

This release no longer includes `cats-state` or `cats-free` artifacts, since
the `cats.state` and `cats.free` packages have been moved into `cats-core`.

If you've checked out the GitHub repository locally, it would be a good idea to
update your remote to point to the new organization, which will typically look
like this (note that you should confirm that `origin` is the appropriate
remote name):

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:typelevel/cats.git
```

This release includes a large number of breaking changes, including most
prominently the introduction of a new `Cartesian` type class that is a supertype
of `Monad` (and many other types). If you use the `|@|` syntax that had
previously been provided by `Apply`, you'll need to change your imports from
`cats.syntax.apply._` to `cats.syntax.cartesian._`. For example:

```scala
scala> import cats.Eval, cats.syntax.cartesian._
import cats.Eval
import cats.syntax.cartesian._

scala> (Eval.now("v") |@| Eval.now(0.4)).tupled
res0: cats.Eval[(String, Double)] = cats.Eval$$anon$5@104f8bbd
```

Other changes in this release are described below.

This version includes API changes:

* [#555](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/555): `|@|` syntax is now
  provided by `cats.syntax.cartesian`

  `ap` has been reversed (now function first)
* [#833](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/833): `ap` on
  `CartesianBuilderN` is now `apWith`
* [#782](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/782): `State` now uses `Eval`
  instead of `Trampoline` for stack safety
* [#697](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/697): `or` for natural
  transformations is now an instance method

  related types) are now in the core module
* [#611](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/611): `Validated` now has an
  `andThen` method that provides binding (but without the `for`-comprehension

* [#530](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/530): `Streaming.take(n).toList` no
  longer evaluates the `n + 1`-st element
* [#538](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/538): `OneAnd`'s instances are
  properly prioritized

There are also many improvements to the documentation, tutorials, laws, tests,
and benchmarks:

* [#522](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/522): ScalaTest's `===` now uses `Eq`
  instances
* [#502](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/502): `Traverse`'s laws verify the
  consistency of `foldMap` and `traverse`
* [#519](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/519): Benchmarks (and performance
  improvements) for `Eval`
* â¦and many others

## Version 0.2.0

> 2015 August 31

Version 0.2.0 is the second release of the Cats library.

The most exciting feature of this release is Scala.js support, which
comes courtesy of much hard work by the Scala.js community (especially
Alistair Johnson). The SBT build configuration and project layout were
updated to support building for both the JVM and JS platforms.

Since the 0.1.2 release there was wide agreement that the split
between `cats-core` and `cats-std` was awkward. The two projects have
been combined into `cats-core`, meaning that type class instances for
common types like `List` are now available in `cats-core`.

There was also a concerted effort to improve and add documentation to
the project. Many people helped find typos, broken links, and places
where the docs could be improved. In particular, the following
tutorials were added or overhauled:

 * `Applicative`
 * `Const`
 * `Foldable`
 * `Free`
 * `FreeApplicative`
 * `Kleisli`
 * `Monad`
 * `Monoid`
 * `Semigroup`
 * `SemigroupK`
 * `Traverse`
 * `Validated`
 * `Xor`

Several new type classes and data types were introduced:

 * `Choice[F[_, _]]`
 * `Group[A]`
 * `MonadReader[F[_, _], R]`
 * `Streaming[A]` and `StreamingT[F[_], A]`
 * `Prod[F[_], G[_], A]` and `Func[F[_], A, B]`

Syntax tests were added to ensure that existing syntax worked, and
there has been some movement to enrich existing types with syntax to
make converting them to Cats types easier.

The previous `Fold[A]` type, which was used to support lazy folds, has
been replaced with `Eval[A]`. This type supports both strict and lazy
evaluation, supports lazy `map` and `flatMap`, and is trampolined for
stack safety. The definition of `Foldable#foldRight` has been updated
to something much more idiomatic and easier to reason about. The goal
is to support laziness in Cats via the `Eval[A]` type wherever
possible.

In addition to these specific changes there were numerous small bug
fixes, additions, improvements, and updates. Thanks to everyone who
filed issues, participated in the Cats Gitter channel, submitted code,
or helped review pull requests.

## Version 0.1.2

> 2015 July 17

(Due to problems with publishing 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are incomplete.)

Version 0.1.2 is the first non-snapshot version of the Cats library!
It is intended to assist the creation of dependent libraries and to be
an early look at Cats' design.

Much of the library is quite mature, but there are no source- or
binary-compatibility guarantees at this time. The overarching design
of the library is still somewhat in flux, although mostly we expect
there will be new type classes, instances, and syntax. Some package
and module boundaries may also shift.
