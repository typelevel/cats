The name *Cats* is a playful shortening of the word *category*. This term derives from
*Category theory*, a branch of abstract mathematics with far reaching implications
in Computer Science that
gained popularity in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). the Cats library implements
Category theory concepts in Scala, owing a debit to Haskell's pioneering efforts to codify
Category theory concepts in a language. Cats has many similiarities to Haskell's codification
of Category theory into a computer language, but with some improvements along with implementation
details specific to Scala.

While it is not necessary to understand the math of Category theory in order to
use the Cats library, understanding the
theoretical roots can enhance the developers ability to use the Cats library more
effectively. Those interested in a (gentle) introduction to the math should read
Bartosz Milewski's [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).
I suggest studying this material in conjunction with his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)
where he presents this same material.

# Books
 * [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
   by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason - While this book does not
   specifically cover Cats, it is a great introduction to functional
   programming in Scala in general and covers some of the abstractions
   that can be found in Cats.
 * [Scala with Cats](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/) 
   by Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell - The aims of this book are two-fold: 
   to introduce monads, functors, and other functional programming patterns
   as a way to structure program design, and to explain how these 
   concepts are implemented in Cats.

# Tutorials
 * [herding cats](http://eed3si9n.com/herding-cats/) by Eugene Yokota
 * [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/cats) by 47 Degrees
   offers multiple online exercises to learn about the type classes and
   datatypes included in Cats.
 
# Videos
 * [Functional Structures in Scala](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrwDVdSrYE6dy14XCmUtRAJuhCxuzJp0) 
   by [Michael Pilquist](https://github.com/MPilquist) offers a series
   of lectures about basic functional structures. 
 * [Category Theory for Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) 
   by [Bartosz Milewski](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski) is a series 
   of category theory lectures oriented towards programmers. The sample code
   is in basic Haskell/C++ but the course is designed for programmers of all 
   background to follow. 
* [Easy and efficient data validation with Cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8nGAo3Jp-Q) by [Daniela Sfregola](https://danielasfregola.com/)  this talk introduces Cats, and some of its most interesting components for data validation. In particular, we’ll discuss some options to achieve efficient and expressive data validation. We will also argue that, compared to other options in the language, Cats is particularly suited for the task thanks to its easy-to-use data types and more approachable syntax.
