/**
 * An instance of `NotNull[A]` indicates that `A` does not have a static type
 * of `Null`.
 *
 * This can be useful in preventing `Null` from being inferred when a type
 * parameter is omitted.
 *
 * This trait is used along with ambiguous implicits to achieve the goal of
 * preventing inference of `Null`. This ambiguous implicit trick has been used
 * in the Scala community for some time. [[https://gist.github.com/milessabin/de58f3ba7024d51dcc1a Here]]
 * is an early example of such a trick being used in a similar way to prevent a
 * `Nothing` type.
