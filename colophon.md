Cats has been made a much better project, and is a much more enjoyable
project to work on because of many of the other projects on which Cats
is built. Many of these projects have had enhancements made in order
to benefit Cats, for which we are grateful.

We would like to thank the maintainers of these supporting projects,
and we'd encourage you to check out these projects and consider
integrating them into your own projects.

 * [simulacrum](https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum) for minimizing typeclass boilerplate
 * [machinist](https://github.com/typelevel/machinist) for optimizing implicit operators
 * [scalacheck](http://scalacheck.org) for property-based testing
 * [discipline](https://github.com/typelevel/discipline) for encoding and testing laws
 * [kind-projector](https://github.com/non/kind-projector) for type lambda syntax
 * [algebra](https://github.com/non/algebra) for algebraic structures shared between Cats, [Spire](https://github.com/non/spire), and [Algebird](https://github.com/twitter/algebird)
 * [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) type-checked example code makes sure that our examples stay in sync with the rest of our source

There are other libraries that aim to foster Functional Programming in the Scala programming language which Cats has a relationship to:

* [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) The project which directly inspires Cats. Currently Cats borrows some code directly from scalaz.
* [Structures](https://github.com/mpilquist/Structures) A project very similar in
nature to Cats, also derived from scalaz. The Structures and Cats
projects have had a healthy relationship of sharing both ideas and code.
