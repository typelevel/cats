/**
 * A lattice is a set `A` together with two operations (meet and
 * join). Both operations individually constitute semilattices (join-
 * and meet-semilattices respectively): each operation is commutative,
 * associative, and idempotent.
 *
 * Join can be thought of as finding a least upper bound (supremum),
 * and meet can be thought of as finding a greatest lower bound
 * (infimum).
 *
 * The join and meet operations are also linked by absorption laws:
 *
 *   meet(a, join(a, b)) = join(a, meet(a, b)) = a
