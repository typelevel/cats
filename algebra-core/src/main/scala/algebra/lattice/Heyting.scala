/**
 * Heyting algebras are bounded lattices that are also equipped with
 * an additional binary operation `imp` (for implication, also
 * written as →).
 *
 * Implication obeys the following laws:
 *
 *  - a → a = 1
 *  - a ∧ (a → b) = a ∧ b
 *  - b ∧ (a → b) = b
 *  - a → (b ∧ c) = (a → b) ∧ (a → c)
 *
 * In heyting algebras, `and` is equivalent to `meet` and `or` is
 * equivalent to `join`; both methods are available.
 *
 * Heyting algebra also define `complement` operation (sometimes
 * written as ¬a). The complement of `a` is equivalent to `(a → 0)`,
 * and the following laws hold:
 *
 *  - a ∧ ¬a = 0
 *
 * However, in Heyting algebras this operation is only a
 * pseudo-complement, since Heyting algebras do not necessarily
 * provide the law of the excluded middle. This means that there is no
 * guarantee that (a ∨ ¬a) = 1.
 *
 * Heyting algebras model intuitionistic logic. For a model of
 * classical logic, see the boolean algebra type class implemented as
 * `Bool`.
