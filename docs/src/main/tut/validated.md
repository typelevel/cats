# Validated

Imagine you are filling out a web form to signup for an account. You input your username and password and submit.
Response comes back saying your username can't have dashes in it, so you make some changes and resubmit. Can't
have special characters either. Change, resubmit. Passwords need to have at least one capital letter. Change,
resubmit. Password needs to have at least one number.

Or perhaps you're reading from a configuration file. One could imagine the configuration library you're using returns
a `scala.util.Try`, or maybe a `scala.util.Either` (or `cats.data.Xor`). Your parsing may look something like:

```scala
for {
  url  <- config[String]("url")
  port <- config[Int]("port")
} yield ConnectionParams(url, port)
```

You run your program and it says key "url" not found, turns out the key was "endpoint". So you change your code
and re-run. Now it says the "port" key was not a well-formed integer.

It would be nice to have all of these errors be reported simultaneously. That the username can't have dashes can
be validated separately from it not having special characters, as well as from the password needing to have certain
requirements. A misspelled (or missing) field in a config can be validated separately from another field not being
well-formed.

Enter `Validated`.

## Parallel validation
Our goal is to report any and all errors across independent bits of data. For instance, when we ask for several
pieces of configuration, each configuration field can be validated separately from one another. How then do we
enforce that the data we are working with is independent? We ask for both of them up front.

As our running example, we will look at config parsing. Our config will be represented by a
`Map[String, String]`. Parsing will be handled by a `Read` type class - we provide instances
just for `String` and `Int` for brevity.

```tut:silent
trait Read[A] {
  def read(s: String): Option[A]
}

object Read {
  def apply[A](implicit A: Read[A]): Read[A] = A

  implicit val stringRead: Read[String] =
    new Read[String] { def read(s: String): Option[String] = Some(s) }

  implicit val intRead: Read[Int] =
    new Read[Int] {
      def read(s: String): Option[Int] =
        if (s.matches("-?[0-9]+")) Some(s.toInt)
        else None
    }
}
```

Then we enumerate our errors - when asking for a config value, one of two things can
go wrong: the field is missing, or it is not well-formed with regards to the expected
type.

```tut:silent
sealed abstract class ConfigError
final case class MissingConfig(field: String) extends ConfigError
final case class ParseError(field: String) extends ConfigError
```

We need a data type that can represent either a successful value (a parsed configuration),
or an error.

```scala
sealed abstract class Validated[+E, +A]

object Validated {
  final case class Valid[+A](a: A) extends Validated[Nothing, A]
  final case class Invalid[+E](e: E) extends Validated[E, Nothing]
}
```

Now we are ready to write our parser.

```tut:silent
import cats.data.Validated
import cats.data.Validated.{Invalid, Valid}

case class Config(map: Map[String, String]) {
  def parse[A : Read](key: String): Validated[ConfigError, A] =
    map.get(key) match {
      case None        => Invalid(MissingConfig(key))
      case Some(value) =>
        Read[A].read(value) match {
          case None    => Invalid(ParseError(key))
          case Some(a) => Valid(a)
        }
    }
}
```

Everything is in place to write the parallel validator. Recall that we can only do parallel
validation if each piece is independent. How do we enforce the data is independent? By asking
for all of it up front. Let's start with two pieces of data.

```tut:silent
def parallelValidate[E, A, B, C](v1: Validated[E, A], v2: Validated[E, B])(f: (A, B) => C): Validated[E, C] =
  (v1, v2) match {
    case (Valid(a), Valid(b))       => Valid(f(a, b))
    case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_))   => i
    case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_))   => i
    case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) => ???
  }
```

We've run into a problem. In the case where both have errors, we want to report both. But we have
no way of combining the two errors into one error! Perhaps we can put both errors into a `List`,
but that seems needlessly specific - clients may want to define their own way of combining errors.

How then do we abstract over a binary operation? The `Semigroup` type class captures this idea.

```tut:silent
import cats.Semigroup

def parallelValidate[E : Semigroup, A, B, C](v1: Validated[E, A], v2: Validated[E, B])(f: (A, B) => C): Validated[E, C] =
  (v1, v2) match {
    case (Valid(a), Valid(b))       => Valid(f(a, b))
    case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_))   => i
    case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_))   => i
    case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) => Invalid(Semigroup[E].combine(e1, e2))
  }
```

Perfect! But.. going back to our example, we don't have a way to combine `ConfigError`s. But as clients,
we can change our `Validated` values where the error can be combined, say, a `List[ConfigError]`. It is
more common however to use a `NonEmptyList[ConfigError]` - the `NonEmptyList` statically guarantees we
have at least one value, which aligns with the fact that if we have an `Invalid`, then we most
certainly have at least one error. This technique is so common there is a convenient method on `Validated`
called `toValidatedNel` that turns any `Validated[E, A]` value to a `Validated[NonEmptyList[E], A]`.
Additionally, the type alias `ValidatedNel[E, A]` is provided.

Time to parse.

```tut:silent
import cats.SemigroupK
import cats.data.NonEmptyList
import cats.std.list._

case class ConnectionParams(url: String, port: Int)

val config = Config(Map(("endpoint", "127.0.0.1"), ("port", "not an int")))

implicit val nelSemigroup: Semigroup[NonEmptyList[ConfigError]] =
  SemigroupK[NonEmptyList].algebra[ConfigError]

implicit val readString: Read[String] = Read.stringRead
implicit val readInt: Read[Int] = Read.intRead
```

Any and all errors are reported!

```tut
val v1 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String]("url").toValidatedNel,
                          config.parse[Int]("port").toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)

val v2 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String]("endpoint").toValidatedNel,
                          config.parse[Int]("port").toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)

val config = Config(Map(("endpoint", "127.0.0.1"), ("port", "1234")))
val v3 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String]("endpoint").toValidatedNel,
                          config.parse[Int]("port").toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)
```

## Apply
Our `parallelValidate` function looks awfully like the `Apply#map2` function.

```scala
def map2[F[_], A, B, C](fa: F[A], fb: F[B])(f: (A, B) => C): F[C]
```

Which can be defined in terms of `Apply#ap` and `Apply#map`, the very functions needed to create an `Apply` instance.

Can we perhaps define an `Apply` instance for `Validated`? Better yet, can we define an `Applicative` instance?

```tut:silent
import cats.Applicative

implicit def validatedApplicative[E : Semigroup]: Applicative[Validated[E, ?]] =
  new Applicative[Validated[E, ?]] {
    def ap[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: Validated[E, A => B]): Validated[E, B] =
      (fa, f) match {
        case (Valid(a), Valid(fab)) => Valid(fab(a))
        case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_)) => i
        case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_)) => i
        case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) => Invalid(Semigroup[E].combine(e1, e2))
      }

    def pure[A](x: A): Validated[E, A] = Validated.valid(x)
    def map[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: A => B): Validated[E, B] = fa.map(f)
    def product[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A], fb: Validated[E, B]): Validated[E, (A, B)] = ap(fb)(fa.map(a => b => (a, b)))
  }
```

Awesome! And now we also get access to all the goodness of `Applicative`, among which include
`map{2-22}`, as well as the `Apply` syntax `|@|`.

We can now easily ask for several bits of configuration and get any and all errors returned back.

```tut:silent
import cats.Apply
import cats.data.ValidatedNel

implicit val nelSemigroup: Semigroup[NonEmptyList[ConfigError]] =
  SemigroupK[NonEmptyList].algebra[ConfigError]

val config = Config(Map(("name", "cat"), ("age", "not a number"), ("houseNumber", "1234"), ("lane", "feline street")))

case class Address(houseNumber: Int, street: String)
case class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)
```

Thus.

```tut
val personFromConfig: ValidatedNel[ConfigError, Person] =
  Apply[ValidatedNel[ConfigError, ?]].map4(config.parse[String]("name").toValidatedNel,
                                           config.parse[Int]("age").toValidatedNel,
                                           config.parse[Int]("house_number").toValidatedNel,
                                           config.parse[String]("street").toValidatedNel) {
    case (name, age, houseNumber, street) => Person(name, age, Address(houseNumber, street))
  }
```

## Of `flatMap`s and `Xor`s
`Option` has `flatMap`, `Xor` has `flatMap`, where's `Validated`'s? Let's try to implement it - better yet,
let's implement the `Monad` type class.

```tut:silent
import cats.Monad

implicit def validatedMonad[E]: Monad[Validated[E, ?]] =
  new Monad[Validated[E, ?]] {
    def flatMap[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: A => Validated[E, B]): Validated[E, B] =
      fa match {
        case Valid(a)     => f(a)
        case i@Invalid(_) => i
      }

    def pure[A](x: A): Validated[E, A] = Valid(x)
  }
```

Note that all `Monad` instances are also `Applicative` instances, where `ap` is defined as

```tut:silent
trait Monad[F[_]] {
  def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
  def pure[A](x: A): F[A]

  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B] =
    flatMap(fa)(f.andThen(pure))

  def ap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: F[A => B]): F[B] =
    flatMap(fa)(a => map(f)(fab => fab(a)))
}
```

However, the `ap` behavior defined in terms of `flatMap` does not behave the same as that of
our `ap` defined above. Observe:

```tut
val v = validatedMonad.tuple2(Validated.invalidNel[String, Int]("oops"), Validated.invalidNel[String, Double]("uh oh"))
```

This one short circuits! Therefore, if we were to define a `Monad` (or `FlatMap`) instance for `Validated` we would
have to override `ap` to get the behavior we want. But then the behavior of `flatMap` would be inconsistent with
that of `ap`, not good. Therefore, `Validated` has only an `Applicative` instance.

## `Validated` vs `Xor`

We've established that an error-accumulating data type such as `Validated` can't have a valid `Monad` instance. Sometimes the task at hand requires error-accumulation. However, sometimes we want a monadic structure that we can use for sequential validation (such as in a for-comprehension). This leaves us in a bit of a conundrum.

Cats has decided to solve this problem by using separate data structures for error-accumulation (`Validated`) and short-circuiting monadic behavior (`Xor`).

If you are trying to decide whether you want to use `Validated` or `Xor`, a simple heuristic is to use `Validated` if you want error-accumulation and to otherwise use `Xor`.

## Sequential Validation

If you do want error accumulation but occasionally run into places where you sequential validation is needed, then `Validated` provides a couple methods that may be helpful.

### `andThen`
The `andThen` method is similar to `flatMap` (such as `Xor.flatMap`). In the cause of success, it passes the valid value into a function that returns a new `Validated` instance.

```tut
val houseNumber = config.parse[Int]("house_number").andThen{ n =>
   if (n >= 0) Validated.valid(n)
   else Validated.invalid(ParseError("house_number"))
}
```

### `withXor`
The `withXor` method allows you to temporarily turn a `Validated` instance into an `Xor` instance and apply it to a function.

```tut:silent
import cats.data.Xor

def positive(field: String, i: Int): ConfigError Xor Int = {
  if (i >= 0) Xor.right(i)
  else Xor.left(ParseError(field))
}
```

Thus.

```tut
val houseNumber = config.parse[Int]("house_number").withXor{ xor: ConfigError Xor Int =>
  xor.flatMap{ i =>
    positive("house_number", i)
  }
}
```
