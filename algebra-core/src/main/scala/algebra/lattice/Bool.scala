/**
 * Boolean algebras are Heyting algebras with the additional
 * constraint that the law of the excluded middle is true
 * (equivalently, double-negation is true).
 *
 * This means that in addition to the laws Heyting algebras obey,
 * boolean algebras also obey the following:
 *
 *  - (a ∨ ¬a) = 1
 *  - ¬¬a = a
 *
 * Boolean algebras generalize classical logic: one is equivalent to
 * "true" and zero is equivalent to "false". Boolean algebras provide
 * additional logical operators such as `xor`, `nand`, `nor`, and
 * `nxor` which are commonly used.
 *
 * Every boolean algebras has a dual algebra, which involves reversing
 * true/false as well as and/or.
