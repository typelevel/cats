* [#1987](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1987) Add `mapK` to `transformers`  by @andyscott / @LukaJCB  

To migrate from 1.0.0-MF.

* The rename of `Cartesian` to `Semigroupal` and `EitherT.liftT` to `EitherT.liftF` can be done automatically through scalafix we provide. See instructions [here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/scalafix/README.md).
* For `FlatMap`'s `>>` and `<<`, use `Apply`'s `*>` and `<*` instead.
* `Profunctor` and `Strong` were moved to the `cats.arrow` package,  `Bifunctor`, `Invariant` and `Contravariant` were moved to the `cats` root package.
* `SemigroupK[λ[α => Kleisli[F, α, α]]]` and `MonoidK[λ[α => Kleisli[F, α, α]]]` are no longer implicitly available, Use `Kleisli.endoSemigroupK` and `Kleisli.endoMonoidK` to get them explicitly.
* law testing for type classes in `cats.kernel` was made consistent with the law testing in `cats.core`. Check [here](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/lawtesting.html) for a guide on how to test cats type class instances. 
* `NonEmptyList.concat` that takes `NonEmptlyList` was deprecated, use `NonEmptyList.concatNel` instead.
* `Monoid` no longer has a `InvariantMonoidal` instance, we discovered that it's not lawful. It has have an `Invariant` and a `Semigroupal` (new name for `Cartesian`) instance. 
* `Foldable.iterateRight` now takes an `Iterable` instead of `Iterator`, see #1973 for rationale. 
* `Foldable` for `Set` and `Traversable` for `Map` were moved to Alleycats, see #1831 for rationale.
* `cats.data.Kleisli#transform` and `cats.free.Coyoneda#transform` were deprecated and replaced by `mapK`

## Version 1.0.0-MF

> 2017 Aug 3

`MF` stands for milestone final. This is the last non-RC release before 1.0.0.
 The main purpose/focus of this release is to offer a relatively stable API to
 work with prior to 1.0.0. It can be deemed as a proposal for the final API
 we are going to maintain binary compatibility after 1.0.
 We will give community some time to validate it before we release 1.0.0-RC1.
 
### To migrate from 0.9.0

We apologize for the number of breaking changes in this release. We are trying to include
as many breaking changes as possible in this release before we lock down the API. 
  
 * `cats` no longer publishes the all-inclusive bundle package `"org.typelevel" % "cats"`, use `cats-core`, `cats-free`, or `cats-law` 
   accordingly instead. If you need `cats.free`, use `"org.typelevel" % "cats-free"`, if you need `cats-laws` use 
   `"org.typelevel" % "cats-laws"`, if neither, use `"org.typelevel" % "cats-core"`.
 * `cats.free.Inject` is moved from `cats-free` to `cats-core` and renamed to `cats.InjectK`;
   `cats.data.Prod` is renamed to `cats.data.Tuple2K`; `cats.data.Coproduct` is renamed to
   `cats.data.EitherK`
 * All `Unapply` enabled methods, e.g. `sequenceU`, `traverseU`, etc. are removed. `Unapply`
   enabled syntax ops are also removed. Please use the partial unification SI-2712 fix
   instead. The easiest way might be this [sbt-plugin](https://github.com/fiadliel/sbt-partial-unification).
 *  `FunctorFilter`, `MonadFilter`, `MonadReader`, `MonadState`, `MonadTrans`, `MonadWriter` and `TraverseFilter` are no longer in `cats`, the functionalities they provided are inherited by the new [cats-mtl](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl) project. Please check [here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl#migration-guide) for migration guide.
 *  `MonadCombine` is no longer in cats. Use `Alternative` or `Monad` + `MonoidK` instead.
 * `CartesianBuilder` (i.e. `|@|`) syntax is deprecated, use the apply syntax on tuples instead. E.g. `(x |@| y |@| z).map(...)` should be replaced by `(x, y, z).mapN(...)`. If you are getting "`mapN` not found" error message, it could be due to SI-2712, see the 3rd migration item above. 
 * Apply syntax on tuple (e.g. `(x, y, z).map3(...)`)  was moved from `cats.syntax.tuple._` to `cats.syntax.apply._` and renamed to `mapN`, `contramapN` and `imapN` respectively.
 * The creation methods (`left`, `right`, `apply`, `pure`, etc.) in `EitherT` were improved to take less
   type arguments.
 * Several `cats-core` type class instances for `cats.kernel` were moved from their companion objects to separate traits
   and thus require imports from `cats.instances.xxx._` (or the recommended `import cats.implicits._`) now. See #1659 for more details. 
 * `Free.suspend` is renamed to `Free.defer` for consistency. 
 * `traverse1_`, `intercalate1` and `sequence1_` in `Reducible` were renamed to `nonEmptyTraverse_`, `nonEmptyIntercalate` and `nonEmptySequence_` respectively. 
 * `foldLeftM` is removed from `Free`, use `foldM` on `Foldable` instead, see #1117 for detail. 
 * `iteratorFoldM` was removed from `Foldable` due to #1716
 * `Split` is removed, and the method `split` is moved to `Arrow`. Note that only under `CommutativeArrow` does it guarantee the non-interference between the effects. see #1567

If you feel adventurous you can try the experimental Scalafix rewrites.
See all the available rewrites and the instructions [here](/scalafix/README.md).

## Version 0.9.0

> 2017 January 15

The biggest user-facing change in this release is to the behavior of the `flatMap` (and related methods) provided by `EitherOps` for the standard library's `Either` for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. These methods now match the behavior of the `flatMap` on `Either` in Scala 2.12 in that they don't require the left-hand side types to match.

For example, the following would previously compile on 2.12, but not 2.10 or 2.11:

```scala
import cats.syntax.either._

sealed abstract class AppError
case object Error1 extends AppError
case object Error2 extends AppError

val either1: Either[Error1.type, String] = Right("hi")
val either2: Either[Error2.type, String] = Right("bye")

val result: Either[AppError, String] = for {
  v1 <- either1
  v2 <- either2
} yield v1 + v2
```

This code now works equivalently on all supported Scala versions.

Changes:

 * [#1424](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1424): `NonEmptyList` and `NonEmptyVector` are now covariant
 * [#1506](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1506): `flatMap` provided by `Either` syntax matches 2.12's `Either#flatMap`
 * [#1466](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1466): Improved stack safety for `StateT`
 * [#1510](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1510): `catchNonFatal` for `Future` is now asynchronous

Bug fixes:

 * [#1465](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1465) and [#1507](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1507): Stack safety law for `Monad#tailRecM` is less eager and doesn't throw exceptions

New type class instances:

 * [#1475](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1475): `Reducible` instances for `Eval` and `Id`

 * [#1454](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1454): `asLeft` and `asRight` syntax methods for creating `Either` values
 * [#1468](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1468): `tupleLeft` and `tupleRight` for `Functor`
 * [#1500](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1500): `putLeft`, `putRight`, `mergeLeft`, and `mergeRight` methods for `Ior`
 * [#1495](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1495): `show` string interpolator
 * [#1448](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1448): `Validated#findValid` (like `orElse` but error accumulating)
 * [#1455](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1455): `reverse` for `NonEmptyList`
 * [#1517](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1517): `zipWithIndex` for `NonEmptyList`
 * [#1512](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1512) and [#1514](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1514): `filterNot` for `NonEmptyList` and `NonEmptyVector`
 * [#1480](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1480): `FunctionK#and`
 * [#1481](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1481): `EitherT.cond`

## Version 0.7.2

> 2016 September 1

Version 0.7.2 is a patch release that was released to fix a major bug
([#1346](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1346)) that appeared
in 0.7.0. It also contains several other improvements.

It should be safe to upgrade from 0.7.0 to 0.7.2 -- there are no major
API changes between these releases.

### Changes

Fixes:

 * [#1347](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1347): fixes broken `Monoid[Map[K, V]].combineAll` implementation.
 * [#1304](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1304): fix `CoflatMap` documentation.
 * [#1322](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1322): fix SBT commands (`release`, `validate`, etc.).
 * [#1311](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1311): rename some implicit instances for consistency.

Additions:

 * [#1319](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1347): add missing `BigDecimal` instances.
 * [#1324](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1324): add missing function and `BitSet` instances.

Note that 0.7.2 was preceded by a botched 0.7.1. release. Please
avoid using this version of Cats -- it has major incompatibilities
with 0.7.0 and is not documented here.

## Version 0.7.0

> 2016 August 21

Version 0.7.0 is the seventh Cats release, and includes several major rearrangements and changes to names.

### Migration notes

If you're updating from Cats 0.6.0, it's likely that you'll need to make extensive (but mostly mechanical) changes. The following list includes some of the changes that are likely to be necessary for most projects; see the complete list of changes below for more detail.

* All references to `cats.std` will need to be changed to `cats.instances` ([#1140](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1140)). If you're using `cats.std.all` or the other `cats.std` objects with wildcard imports, this is likely to be the only change you need to make. If you are importing or referring to instance definitions by name, you'll need to be aware that the naming convention has changed (see [#1066](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1066), [#1068](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1068), [#1110](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1110), and [#1122](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1122)).
* `NonEmptyList` and `NonEmptyVector` are no longer type aliases for `OneAnd`, so any code using `OneAnd` to construct or pattern match on these types will need to be changed to use `NonEmptyList` or `NonEmptyVector` directly. There are also some API changes; for example, `unwrap` calls will need to be replaced by `toList` or `toVector`, and `NonEmptyList(1, 2, 3)` is now `NonEmptyList.of(1, 2, 3)`.
* `pureEval` has been removed from `Applicative` ([#1234](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1234)), and has not been replaced, so if you are relying on it for laziness or effect capturing (which wasn't enforced or guaranteed), you'll need to find another approach.
* All references to `NaturalTransformation` will need to be replaced by either `FunctionK` or `~>`.
* The `FlatMap` type class now has a `tailRecM` method that is designed to support stack-safe recursive monadic binding. If your monad's `flatMap` is stack safe, you can implement a stack-safe `tailRecM` by calling `Monad#defaultTailRecM`. The stack safety of `tailRecM` is not enforced, but if your implementation is stack safe, you should also provide an instance of the `RecursiveTailRecM` marker type class.
* If you are interpreting a free algebra into a context `F` with `foldMap`, you'll now need `F` to have an instance of the `RecursiveTailRecM` marker type class (in addition to the `Monad` instance).

If you run into any issues while updating, please get in touch on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats).

### Changes

This release includes a fix for a bug in 0.6.0 (also fixed in 0.6.1):

* [#1062](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1062): `Order` instances for tuples are now lexicographic (instead of only comparing first elements)

And other bug fixes:

* [#1096](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1096): `inj` and `prj` on `Inject` now work consistently with respect to `null`

And some additions:

* [#1289](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1289) and [#1306](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1306): `EitherT` and improved `Either` syntax
* [#1280](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1280): `FlatMap` now has a `tailRecM` method
* [#1280](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1280): `RecursiveTailRecM` marker type class indicating that `tailRecM` is stack safe
* [#1266](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1266): `FreeT` monad transformer
* [#1225](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1225): `FunctorFilter` and `TraverseFilter`

## Version 0.4.1

> 2016 February 4

Version 0.4.1 is a patch release in the 0.4 series and is binary compatible with
version 0.4.0.

This patch fixes bugs with the `dropWhile` methods on `Streaming` and
`StreamingT`.

This release corrects outdated build/POM metadata, which should fix API doc URLS.

Bug fixes:

* [#856](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/856): Fix `Streaming` and `StreamingT` `dropWhile` functions

Build/publishing changes:

* [#852](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/852) Update build with org change

Documentation and site improvements:

* [#859](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/859) Add Contravariant documentation page
* [#861](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/861) Docs: Revive useful links section. Update URLs

## Version 0.4.0

> 2016 February 1

Version 0.4.0 is the fourth release of the Cats library, and the first release
published under the `org.typelevel` group from the
[Typelevel](https://github.com/typelevel) organization on GitHub (previous
releases had been published to `org.spire-math` from `non/cats`). This means
that users will need to change the `groupId` for their Cats dependencies when
updating. If you have a line like this in your SBT build configuration, for
example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.spire-math" %% "cats" % "0.3.0"
```

You will need to change it to the following:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats" % "0.4.0"
```

This release no longer includes `cats-state` or `cats-free` artifacts, since
the `cats.state` and `cats.free` packages have been moved into `cats-core`.

If you've checked out the GitHub repository locally, it would be a good idea to
update your remote to point to the new organization, which will typically look
like this (note that you should confirm that `origin` is the appropriate
remote name):

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:typelevel/cats.git
```

This release includes a large number of breaking changes, including most
prominently the introduction of a new `Cartesian` type class that is a supertype
of `Monad` (and many other types). If you use the `|@|` syntax that had
previously been provided by `Apply`, you'll need to change your imports from
`cats.syntax.apply._` to `cats.syntax.cartesian._`. For example:

```scala
scala> import cats.Eval, cats.syntax.cartesian._
import cats.Eval
import cats.syntax.cartesian._

scala> (Eval.now("v") |@| Eval.now(0.4)).tupled
res0: cats.Eval[(String, Double)] = cats.Eval$$anon$5@104f8bbd
```

Other changes in this release are described below.

This version includes API changes:

* [#555](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/555): `|@|` syntax is now
  provided by `cats.syntax.cartesian`
* [#835](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/835): `State` and `StateT` are
  now in the `cats.data` package
* [#781](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/781): `combine` on `SemigroupK`
  is now `combineK`
* [#821](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/821) and
  [#833](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/833): The order of arguments for
  `ap` has been reversed (now function first)
* [#833](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/833): `ap` on
  `CartesianBuilderN` is now `apWith`
* [#782](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/782): `State` now uses `Eval`
  instead of `Trampoline` for stack safety
* [#697](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/697): `or` for natural
  transformations is now an instance method

## Version 0.2.0

> 2015 August 31

Version 0.2.0 is the second release of the Cats library.

The most exciting feature of this release is Scala.js support, which
comes courtesy of much hard work by the Scala.js community (especially
Alistair Johnson). The SBT build configuration and project layout were
updated to support building for both the JVM and JS platforms.

Since the 0.1.2 release there was wide agreement that the split
between `cats-core` and `cats-std` was awkward. The two projects have
been combined into `cats-core`, meaning that type class instances for
common types like `List` are now available in `cats-core`.

There was also a concerted effort to improve and add documentation to
the project. Many people helped find typos, broken links, and places
where the docs could be improved. In particular, the following
tutorials were added or overhauled:

 * `Applicative`
 * `Const`
 * `Foldable`
 * `Free`
 * `FreeApplicative`
 * `Kleisli`
 * `Monad`
 * `Monoid`
 * `Semigroup`
 * `SemigroupK`
 * `Traverse`
 * `Validated`
 * `Xor`

Several new type classes and data types were introduced:

 * `Choice[F[_, _]]`
 * `Group[A]`
 * `MonadReader[F[_, _], R]`
 * `Streaming[A]` and `StreamingT[F[_], A]`
 * `Prod[F[_], G[_], A]` and `Func[F[_], A, B]`

Syntax tests were added to ensure that existing syntax worked, and
there has been some movement to enrich existing types with syntax to
make converting them to Cats types easier.

The previous `Fold[A]` type, which was used to support lazy folds, has
been replaced with `Eval[A]`. This type supports both strict and lazy
evaluation, supports lazy `map` and `flatMap`, and is trampolined for
stack safety. The definition of `Foldable#foldRight` has been updated
to something much more idiomatic and easier to reason about. The goal
is to support laziness in Cats via the `Eval[A]` type wherever
possible.

In addition to these specific changes there were numerous small bug
fixes, additions, improvements, and updates. Thanks to everyone who
filed issues, participated in the Cats Gitter channel, submitted code,
or helped review pull requests.

## Version 0.1.2

> 2015 July 17

(Due to problems with publishing 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are incomplete.)

Version 0.1.2 is the first non-snapshot version of the Cats library!
It is intended to assist the creation of dependent libraries and to be
an early look at Cats' design.

Much of the library is quite mature, but there are no source- or
binary-compatibility guarantees at this time. The overarching design
of the library is still somewhat in flux, although mostly we expect
there will be new type classes, instances, and syntax. Some package
and module boundaries may also shift.

For complete credits, see [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) for a list of
people whose work has made this release possible.
