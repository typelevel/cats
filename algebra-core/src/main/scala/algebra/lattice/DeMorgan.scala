/**
 * De Morgan algebras are bounded lattices that are also equipped with
 * a De Morgan involution.
 *
 * De Morgan involution obeys the following laws:
 *
 *  - ¬¬a = a
 *  - ¬(x∧y) = ¬x∨¬y
 *
 * However, in De Morgan algebras this involution does not necessarily
 * provide the law of the excluded middle. This means that there is no
 * guarantee that (a ∨ ¬a) = 1. De Morgan algebra do not not necessarily
 * provide the law of non contradiction either. This means that there is
 * no guarantee that (a ∧ ¬a) = 0.
 *
 * De Morgan algebras are useful to model fuzzy logic. For a model of
 * classical logic, see the boolean algebra type class implemented as
 * [[Bool]].
