/**
 * MonoidK is a universal monoid which operates on kinds.
 *
 * This type class is useful when its type parameter F[_] has a
 * structure that can be combined for any particular type, and which
 * also has an "empty" representation. Thus, MonoidK is like a Monoid
 * for kinds (i.e. parameterized types).
 *
 * A MonoidK[F] can produce a Monoid[F[A]] for any type A.
 *
 * Here's how to distinguish Monoid and MonoidK:
 *
 *  - Monoid[A] allows A values to be combined, and also means there
 *    is an "empty" A value that functions as an identity.
 *
 *  - MonoidK[F] allows two F[A] values to be combined, for any A.  It
 *    also means that for any A, there is an "empty" F[A] value. The
 *    combination operation and empty value just depend on the
 *    structure of F, but not on the structure of A.
