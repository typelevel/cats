/**
 * A mix-in for inheriting tailRecM on monads which define a stack-safe flatMap.  This is
 * ''not'' an appropriate trait to use unless you are 100% certain your monad is stack-safe
 * by definition!  If your monad is not stack-safe, then the tailRecM implementation you
 * will inherit will not be sound, and will result in unexpected stack overflows.  This
 * trait is only provided because a large number of monads ''do'' define a stack-safe
 * flatMap, and so this particular implementation was being repeated over and over again.
