/**
 * Priority is a type class for prioritized implicit search.
 *
 * This type class will attempt to provide an implicit instance of `P`
 * (the preferred type). If that type is not available it will
 * fallback to `F` (the fallback type). If neither type is available
 * then a `Priority[P, F]` instance will not be available.
 *
 * This type can be useful for problems where multiple algorithms can
 * be used, depending on the type classes available.
