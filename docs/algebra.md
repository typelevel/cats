# Algebra Overview

Algebra uses type classes to represent algebraic structures. You can use these type classes to represent the abstract capabilities (and requirements) you want generic parameters to possess.

This section will explain the structures available.

## algebraic properties and terminology

We will be talking about properties like *associativity* and *commutativity*. Here is a quick explanation of what those properties mean:

|Name         |Description                                                                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Associative  | If `⊕` is associative, then `a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)` = `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c`.                     |
|Commutative  | If `⊕` is commutative, then `a ⊕ b` = `b ⊕ a`.                                 |
|Identity     | If `id` is an identity for `⊕`, then `a ⊕ id` = `id ⊕ a` = `a`.                |
|Inverse      | If `¬` is an inverse for `⊕` and `id`, then `a ⊕ ¬a` = `¬a ⊕ a` = `id`.        |
|Distributive | If `⊕` and `⊙` distribute, then `a ⊙ (b ⊕ c)` = `(a ⊙ b) ⊕ (a ⊙ c)` and `(a ⊕ b) ⊙ c` = `(a ⊙ c) ⊕ (b ⊙ c)`. |
|Idempotent   | If `⊕` is idempotent, then `a ⊕ a` = `a`. If `f` is idempotent, then `f(f(a))` = `f(a)` |

Though these properties are illustrated with symbolic operators, they work equally-well with functions. When you see `a ⊕ b` that is equivalent to `f(a, b)`: `⊕` is an infix representation of the binary function `f`, and `a` and `b` are values (of some type `A`).

Similarly, when you see `¬a` that is equivalent to `g(a)`: `¬` is a prefix representation of the unary function `g`, and `a` is a value (of some type `A`).

## basic algebraic structures

The most basic structures can be found in the `algebra` package. They all implement a method called `combine`, which is associative. The identity element (if present) will be called `empty`, and the inverse method (if present) will be called `inverse`.

|Name                |Associative?|Commutative?|Identity?|Inverse?|Idempotent?|

## ring-like structures

The `algebra.ring` package contains more sophisticated structures which combine an *additive* operation (called `plus`) and a *multiplicative* operation (called `times`). Additive identity and inverses will be called `zero` and `negate` (respectively); multiplicative identity and inverses will be called `one` and `reciprocal` (respectively).

All ring-like structures are associative for both `+` and `*`, have commutative `+`, and have a `zero` element (an identity for `+`).

|Name                |Has `negate`?|Has `1`?|Has `reciprocal`?|Commutative `*`?|
|--------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
|Semiring            |             |        |                 |                |
|Rng                 |            ✓|        |                 |                |
|Rig                 |             |       ✓|                 |                |
|CommutativeRig      |             |       ✓|                 |               ✓|
|Ring                |            ✓|       ✓|                 |                |
|CommutativeRing     |            ✓|       ✓|                 |               ✓|
|Field               |            ✓|       ✓|                ✓|               ✓|

With the exception of `CommutativeRig` and `Rng`, every lower structure is also an instance of the structures above it. For example, every `Ring` is a `Rig`, every `Field` is a `CommutativeRing`, and so on.

## lattice-like structures

The `algebra.lattice` package contains more structures that can be somewhat ring-like. Rather than `plus` and `times` we have `meet` and `join` both of which are always associative, commutative and idempotent, and as such each can be viewed as a semilattice. Meet can be thought of as the greatest lower bound of two items while join can be thought of as the least upper bound between two items.

When `zero` is present, `join(a, zero)` = `a`. When `one` is present `meet(a, one)` = `a`.

When `meet` and `join` are both present, they obey the absorption law:

 - `meet(a, join(a, b))` = `join(a, meet(a, b)) = a`

Sometimes meet and join distribute, we say it is distributive in this case:

 - `meet(a, join(b, c))` = `join(meet(a, b), meet(a, c))`
 - `join(a, meet(b, c))` = `meet(join(a, b), join(a, c))`

Sometimes an additional binary operation `imp` (for impliciation, also written as →, meet written as ∧) is present. Implication obeys the following laws:

 - `a → a` = `1`
 - `a ∧ (a → b)` = `a ∧ b`
 - `b ∧ (a → b)` = `b`
 - `a → (b ∧ c)` = `(a → b) ∧ (a → c)`

The law of the excluded middle can be expressed as:

 - `(a ∨ (a → 0))` = `1`

|Name                      |Has `join`?|Has `meet`?|Has `zero`?|Has `one`?|Distributive|Has `imp`?|Excludes middle?|

Note that a `BoundedDistributiveLattice` gives you a `CommutativeRig`, but not the other way around: rigs aren't distributive with `a + (b * c) = (a + b) * (a + c)`.

Also, a `Bool` gives rise to a `BoolRing`, since each element can be defined as its own negation. Note, Bool's `.asBoolRing` is not an extension of the `.asCommutativeRig` method as the `plus` operations are defined differently.
