/**
 * Represents a value which may not yet be evaluated.
 *
 * Lazy provides a method to abstract across the evaluation strategy
 * in Scala. There are three supported strategies:
 *
 *  - `Lazy(...)`: call-by-need semantics; the value of `...` will not
 *     be calculated until needed, but will be calculated at most once
 *     (and saved via memoization). Corresponds to Scala's `lazy val`.
 *
 *  - `Lazy.eager(...)`: call-by-value semantics; the value of `...`
 *    will be immediately calculated and saved. This is the default
 *    strategy used by Scala. Corresponds to Scala's `val`.
 *
 *  - `Lazy.byName(...)`: call-by-name semantics; the value of `...`
 *    will not be calculated until needed, and will be calculated
 *    every time it is needed. Corresponds to Scala's `def`.
 *
 * Every Lazy[A] value has (or can calculate) a corresponding A
 * value. You can obtain this value by calling the `.value` method.
