/**
 * GCDRing implements a GCD ring.
 *
 * For two elements x and y in a GCD ring, we can choose two elements d and m
 * such that:
 *
 * d = gcd(x, y)
 * m = lcm(x, y)
 *
 * d * m = x * y
 *
 * Additionally, we require:
 *
 * gcd(0, 0) = 0
 * lcm(x, 0) = lcm(0, x) = 0
 *
 * and commutativity:
 *
 * gcd(x, y) = gcd(y, x)
 * lcm(x, y) = lcm(y, x)
