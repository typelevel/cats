  // There are various concerns people have over Try's ability to
  // satisfy the monad laws. For example, consider the following code:
  //
  //     import scala.util.{Try, Success}
  //
  //     def verify(n: Int): Try[Int] =
  //       if (n == 0) sys.error("nope") else Success(n)
  //
  //     val x = Try(0).flatMap(verify)
  //     val y = verify(0)
  //
  // The monad laws require that `x` and `y` produce the same value,
  // but in this case `x` is a `Failure(_)` and `y` is undefined (due
  // an error being thrown).
  //
  // Since `verify` is not a total function, it is arguable whether
  // this constitutes a law violation, but there is enough concern
  // that the Monad[Try] instance has ended up here in Alleycats.
  //
  // Furthermore, since Cats has introduced a Bimonad[A], the Monad[Try]
  // and Comonad[Try] instances have been replaced by a single Bimonad[Try]
  // instance.
